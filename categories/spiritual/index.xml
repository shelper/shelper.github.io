      <description>It is quite often that sometimes you just could not stop yourself doing something. for instance, I often sit in chair and do not want to go the bathroom until i could not hold it any more&amp;hellip; that happens especially when i try to solve a problem, resolving a program bug&amp;hellip;
so, how can we change this? use the sword of wisdom! the sword of wisdom, is a keen and sharp mind state that can penetrate in to your mind stream.</description>

      <title>How to truly relax yourself</title>

      <description>Relax, means putting down, pushing away, forgetting things. Relax, is not about picking up something called &amp;ldquo;relaxation&amp;rdquo;
Relax is simply let it go, if you can, you should also let it go the thought of &amp;ldquo;let it go&amp;rdquo;
if you cannot do that, then reciting &amp;ldquo;let it go&amp;rdquo; helps you to push away other wondering thoughts, especially those thoughts bothering you, and make yourself agitated.
so relax, is very simple that really don&amp;rsquo;t need you to do anything, yet very difficult, if you try to grab something.</description>
