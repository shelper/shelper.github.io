[{"content":"Using Emacs on windows is always an imperfect experience, luckly windows10 comes with WSL2 now, which lets you install Emacs in WSL2 and use it on windows now. I did some hacking to make the experience little bit better, which includes:\n open any file on windows in emacs@wsl2 setup org-capture on chrome on windows and capture notes using emacs@wsl2 open links in org-mode in emacs@wsl2 using windows default apps. e.g., open https links using chrome on windows, open document links in MS-office on windows, etc. copy paste sharing between windows and wsl2 fix for some keyboard shortcuts that\u0026rsquo;s been screened by windows by default setup outlook to create outlook links(uuid based) for emails/meetings/contacts in outlook, then open links in org-mode using outlook insert files into emacs@wsl2  lets go into the steps for each of the above fixes\nprecondition On windows 10 you can install GWSL to enable emacs@wsl2 with gui, or you can setup your own VcXsrv so you can open emacs@wsl2 with gui.\nopen files on windows using emacs@wsl2 in order to add a context menu to open windows files in WSL2, i created a python file with content below:\nimport sys import subprocess import os import re import win32gui class WindowMgr: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Encapsulates some calls to the winapi for window management\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;

The code on github is not up-to-date. And I have some new thoughts on the framework design. So this article serves as a design documents and welcomes any comments or suggestions.\nBased on my own experience, I often want to process some data or image at multiple stage. Often, I want to change some parameters of certian algorithm to see how the outcomes are changed. It becomes cumbersome and difficult to check after saving a lot of intermedia data, with file names like para1_value1_para1_value2....\nI then thought about it, and decide to write a framework like a pipeline. for a multi-step process, I can connect the processing function of each step and form a pipeline. I decided to use async module in python and if needed, use a generate as the input, so if I want to check the outcome of a multi-step process, I can simply write a generate to feed in the input repeatedly, and with the async feature, I can change the parameters in realtime, and the outcome will change instantaneously or even real time as well.\nthen the next thing is to make this pipeline easier to use, e.g., I used decorator to claim funtions that can be inserted into the pipeline by a single line of code. I made a pipeline class with implementations of pop() and insert() for adding and removing functions in the pipeline I also plan to add input and output check for each functions, so that when I connect two functions, the framework will check if the output of the first matches the input of the second. I am thinking of using a separate file like the header file in c/c++ to describe the input and output of each function.\nfor instance, I have two functions to connect:\n# functions.py def f1(x, y): return x + y, x - y def f2(a, b): return a + b and x, y, a, b are all integers,\nso I can have a separate file with same name but different extension:\n# functions.dsc\rf1 = {\u0026#39;input\u0026#39;: [int, int], \u0026#39;output\u0026#39;: [int, int]}\rf2 = {\u0026#39;input\u0026#39;: [int, int], \u0026#39;output\u0026#39;: [int]} then when connect these two functions I can do:\n# pseudo code:\rif f1[\u0026#39;output\u0026#39;] == f2[\u0026#39;input\u0026#39;]:\rconnect f1 and f2\relse:\rraise FuncInputOutputMismatch() for more complicated cases, the pipeline might have branches and inter-connections within branches. it of course should be one way data flow. it further reminds me the frontend library from facebook that uses one way data flow: the React. There is also a video on this.\nthen I did some research and found something called hot loading it also reminds me the talk given by Bret Victor. it would be such a fantastic tool if some tool like this can be used for scientific data processing\u0026hellip;\nSo I just wonder if there is already something similar or at least some that i can borrow code/ideas from? or is this kind of design idea new? i tend to think it is not, I would like to read more to get a better understanding of such design before i go ahead coding the framework.\n","permalink":"https://shelper.github.io/posts/design-of-a-framework-for-scientific-data-processing/","summary":"I have beening thinking of building such a framework for a while, I started a little project called pypeline.
