the matplotlib uses different backend to render the images, and due to the differences between different backend, some functions are only available for specific backend, for instance, the <code>fig.canvas.update()</code> is a fast way to render new images to the axes, but is only availabe to PyQt4.</p><p>so i was trying to install pyqt4 using homebrew, it failed by saying the osx version is pre-released version and is not supported, and arises 2 errors during make process.</p><p>this is due to the cached info for homebrew is not up-to-date, so you need to run brew update.</p><p>however, this also arises an error of &ldquo;not writable directory: /usr/local, so you need to <code>sudo chown - $user:admin /usr/local</code>, then update shall work, then run <code>brew install pyqt (add --with-python3 if need to support python3.x)</code>.</p><p>now the remaining problem is the pyqt package cannot be imported in python shell because homebrew gives the below message:</p><blockquote><p>Python modules have been installed and Homebrew&rsquo;s site-packages is not
in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules
this formula installed. If you plan to develop with these modules,
please run:
echo &lsquo;import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages&rdquo;)&rsquo; &#187; /path/to/your/python/folder/site-packages/homebrew.pth</p></blockquote><p>you may run <code>import site; site.getsitepackages()</code> to find out the path to your python site-packages folder,
of course, you need to change python2.7 to python3.x for python3 support.</p><p>Another thing is use <code>python3 -m pip</code> instead of <code>pip</code> so to ensure the package will be installed in the default site-packages folder, actually <code>python3 -m pip install pyside</code> successfully installed pyside for python3</p><p>however, i found pyside 1.2.4 does not work due to the @rpath issue, cannot find a solution for it. so i installed pyside 1.2.2 and downloaded [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySide/pyside-setup/1.2.2/pyside_postinstall.py], after running this script, the pyside is succesfully installed and can be imported</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://example.org/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
