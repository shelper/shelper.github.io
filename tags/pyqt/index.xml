      <description>so i was trying to use matplotlib for fast image ploting and updating, and I found a post here. the matplotlib uses different backend to render the images, and due to the differences between different backend, some functions are only available for specific backend, for instance, the fig.canvas.update() is a fast way to render new images to the axes, but is only availabe to PyQt4.
so i was trying to install pyqt4 using homebrew, it failed by saying the osx version is pre-released version and is not supported, and arises 2 errors during make process.</description>
