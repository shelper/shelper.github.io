      <description>so i am using poetry to manage my venv for a project that relies on dozens of PYPI packages. i first thought it would be relatively easy to migrate python3.7 to the latest 3.10. but i was wrong, and i spent hours to fix it. Here is what i&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
first of all, you need to intaall pyenv for multiple version management, a caveat here is that if you use the suggested method to setup (through curl https://pyenv.</description>

      <description>Using Emacs on windows is always an imperfect experience, luckly windows10 comes with WSL2 now, which lets you install Emacs in WSL2 and use it on windows now. I did some hacking to make the experience little bit better, which includes:
 open any file on windows in emacs@wsl2 setup org-capture on chrome on windows and capture notes using emacs@wsl2 open links in org-mode in emacs@wsl2 using windows default apps. e.</description>

      <description>I followed this site for setting up hugo blogging on https://github.com/ using github.io, the instruction is little bit confusion, so just to clarify a little bit here.
  the instructions there uses gh-pages branch to publish your site, this is done by the action peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3. however, for user/organization.github.io pages, the default branch for publishing is main. so if you use this action, you need to change your page branch to gh-pages and set the directory to /root.</description>

      <description>So ccls is a lsp wrapper for clang it works as a backend that indexes source code and gives emacs index information for better navigation and refactoring of c++
I have had a few issues with the tool&amp;rsquo;s setup in emacs enviroment. and found the following things that may need extra attention
 .ccls file, this file basically does two things   tell ccls how to index the file using clang before index the file tell clang how to compile and interpret the code as there is a mixture of options for ccls and arguments for clang, need to pay extra attention  usually lines in .</description>

      <description>A few things to setup the IPython and Jupyter for a best practise.
IPython configuration Change ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/init.ipy for their usage respectively
 To enable versioning of the python/jupyter environment, you need to pip install version_information and then add below, afterward for each IPython notebook file I put %version_information numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas to display my python environment version information  %load_ext version_information  To enable autoloading of modified modules in IPython, add below  %load_ext version_information %load_ext autoreload %autoreload 2  I also added the lines below just because I use them everytime I open IPython  import numpy as np import matplotlib.</description>

      <title>switch recent two buffer alternatively</title>

      <guid>https://shelper.github.io/posts/switch-recent-two-buffer-alterantively/</guid>
      <description>so there is a post described using key chord for fast buffer switching between most recent two buffers. it works for most cases, but if you are using org babel mode and editing source code in the *org src .* buffer, then this *org src .* buffer cannot be accessed by the method described here.
so I made another function to solve this issue, and here it is:
(defun get-next-buffer () (interactive) (if (string= (car (helm-buffer-list)) &amp;#34; *Minibuf-1*&amp;#34;) (switch-to-buffer (car (cdr (helm-buffer-list)))) (switch-to-buffer (car (helm-buffer-list))))) (key-chord-define-global &amp;#34;jk&amp;#34; &amp;#39;get-next-buffer) strangely when switching buffer using `helm-buffer-lists`, and if you exit without selecting any buffer, you gets `*Minibuf-1*` into the buffer list and will switch to minibuffer.</description>

      <description>to use nikola you need to install it with some other packages as well pip instal nikola markdown ws4py watchdog
then to enable markdown, you need to change the conf.py variable POSTS and PAGES
POSTS = ( (&amp;#34;posts/*.md&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;posts&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;post.tmpl&amp;#34;), (&amp;#34;posts/*.rst&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;posts&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;post.tmpl&amp;#34;), (&amp;#34;posts/*.txt&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;posts&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;post.tmpl&amp;#34;), (&amp;#34;posts/*.html&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;posts&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;post.tmpl&amp;#34;), ) PAGES = ( (&amp;#34;pages/*.md&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pages&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;story.tmpl&amp;#34;), (&amp;#34;pages/*.rst&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pages&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;story.tmpl&amp;#34;), (&amp;#34;pages/*.txt&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pages&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;story.tmpl&amp;#34;), (&amp;#34;pages/*.html&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pages&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;story.tmpl&amp;#34;), ) you may also need to change the github settings for easy github deploy</description>

      <description>quote for symbols: (setq symbol) ;; is equivelent to (set &amp;#39;symbol) the quote means; keep as it is, dont try to evaluate, so if no quote, the lisp processor will try to evaluate it, means the symbol (or the first element of the list) has to be evaluatable as either a function, or a defined variable
let vs. let*: (setq y 2) (let ((y 1) (z y)) (list y z)) ⇒ (1 2) (setq y 2) (let* ((y 1) (z y)) (list y z)) ⇒ (1 1) let* binds 1 to y immediately, while let evaluate old y as 2, then list binds 1 to the new y and pring it out</description>

      <description>so i was trying to use matplotlib for fast image ploting and updating, and I found a post here. the matplotlib uses different backend to render the images, and due to the differences between different backend, some functions are only available for specific backend, for instance, the fig.canvas.update() is a fast way to render new images to the axes, but is only availabe to PyQt4.
so i was trying to install pyqt4 using homebrew, it failed by saying the osx version is pre-released version and is not supported, and arises 2 errors during make process.</description>

      <description>using different backends for matplotlib might cause some unexpected issues: today, i am trying to run a program that uses the following function:
plt.figure() figManager = plt.get_current_fig_manager() figManager.window.showMaximized() however, i found when using the backend of Tk, it gives error, saying get_current_fig_manager is not available, so when i switch to qt4egg, everything works well.
how to switch the backend for matplotlib? first find the configure directory for matplotlib on your computer</description>

      <description>several things:
 when using setuptools.find_packages, only packages with __init__.py in its folder will be found only modules imported in the __init__.py will be indexed, means the modules will be added into the dir(module) and accessable by .module_name for python 3, if one modules(py file) in the same folder of another module and relies on that module, you need to put from . import module at the top package name is specified in the setup.</description>

issue1:
ipython shell imports quite some packages/modules/functions and as you may know, import searches current folder as well as the subfolders of the registered module, if there are file with the same name under the current folder, it overrides the file in the registered module, apparently, this causes problems of &amp;ldquo;import error, could not find &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>remove %HOME% (you can put it back later)
  download and install babun
  setup ssh, if you already have ssh keys in the ~/.ssh, copy to the ~ of babun shell and do
  eval `ssh-agent -s`ssh-add if not, copy the ssh pub and private keys to ~/.ssh or use
ssh-add path/to/keys if you are using proxy behind firewall you need: add proxy for babun and change the user -agent (dont know why, but works)  export http_proxy=http://gateway.</description>

      <description>I have beening thinking of building such a framework for a while, I started a little project called pypeline. The code on github is not up-to-date. And I have some new thoughts on the framework design. So this article serves as a design documents and welcomes any comments or suggestions.
Based on my own experience, I often want to process some data or image at multiple stage. Often, I want to change some parameters of certian algorithm to see how the outcomes are changed.</description>

      <guid>https://shelper.github.io/posts/how-to-truly-relax-yourself/</guid>
      <description>Relax, means putting down, pushing away, forgetting things. Relax, is not about picking up something called &amp;ldquo;relaxation&amp;rdquo;
Relax is simply let it go, if you can, you should also let it go the thought of &amp;ldquo;let it go&amp;rdquo;
if you cannot do that, then reciting &amp;ldquo;let it go&amp;rdquo; helps you to push away other wondering thoughts, especially those thoughts bothering you, and make yourself agitated.
so relax, is very simple that really don&amp;rsquo;t need you to do anything, yet very difficult, if you try to grab something.</description>
