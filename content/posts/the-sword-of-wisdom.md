It is quite often that sometimes you just could not stop yourself doing something.
for instance, I often sit in chair and do not want to go the bathroom until i could not hold it any more...
that happens especially when i try to solve a problem, resolving a program bug...

so, how can we change this? use the sword of wisdom!
the sword of wisdom, is a keen and sharp mind state that can penetrate in to your mind stream.
it breaks your flow of thinking, like a sharp knife.

how? because the sword of wisdom uses the wisdom of emptiness.
the wisdom of emptiness breaks your attachment to almost anything.
so, it not only works for letting you move your butt of the chair, it also cuts off your desire of wanting something,
and offer you the power to get away for desire without being obsessed by it.

it is sharper than anything in the world in the aspect of cutting of your attachment.
everyone can use it, as long you calm down, relax, accept and surrender to your surroundings, including people, events, and happenings,
completely, and put it down, by any chance, you will discover the wisdom of emptyness, you let it flows into your mind,
and it will take you away from any strong desire or will.

It is literally a sword, that you can use all the time, although it has no form.
