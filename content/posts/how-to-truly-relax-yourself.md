Relax, means putting down, pushing away, forgetting things.
Relax, is not about picking up something called "relaxation"

Relax is simply let it go, if you can, you should also let it go the thought of "let it go"

if you cannot do that, then reciting "let it go" helps you to push away other wondering thoughts,
especially those thoughts bothering you, and make yourself agitated.

so relax, is very simple that really don't need you to do anything,
yet very difficult, if you try to grab something.

so learn to enjoy relaxation, it is very important and extremely benificial
